## 🎯 How to Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Using Emergent's Built-in Feature (RECOMMENDED)

Look for the **"Save to Github"** button in your Emergent interface:
- Usually located in the chat toolbar
- Or in the top menu bar
- Or near the message input area

**Just click it and your code will be pushed automatically!**

---

### Option 2: Manual Push (If you have GitHub access configured)

If you're working directly in the terminal and have GitHub credentials set up:

```bash
cd /app
git push origin main
```

**Note:** You may need to authenticate:
- If using HTTPS: Enter your GitHub username and Personal Access Token
- If using SSH: Ensure your SSH key is added to GitHub

---

## 🔐 GitHub Authentication Setup (If Needed)

### If you get authentication errors:

#### Method 1: Personal Access Token (PAT)
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
4. Copy the token
5. Use it as your password when pushing

#### Method 2: GitHub CLI
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI (if not installed)
gh auth login
# Follow the prompts
```

#### Method 3: SSH Key
```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Copy public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Add this to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key

# Update remote to use SSH
cd /app
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:abdulrahman-kharzoum/web-google-auth-test.git
git push origin main
```

## ✅ Verification After Push

Once pushed, verify your code on GitHub:

1. **Visit:** https://github.com/abdulrahman-kharzoum/web-google-auth-test

2. **Check these files exist:**
   - [ ] `backend/server.py` (with `/api` routes)
   - [ ] `frontend/package.json` (with proxy config)
   - [ ] `frontend/.env` (with host check disabled)
   - [ ] `frontend/src/App.js` (with improved error handling)
   - [ ] `README.md`
   - [ ] `QUICK_START.md`
   - [ ] Documentation files

3. **Verify key fixes in code:**
   - Open `frontend/package.json` → Check line 4: `"proxy": "http://localhost:8001"`
   - Open `frontend/.env` → Check: `DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true`
   - Open `frontend/src/App.js` → Check improved `storeTokenInBackend` function
